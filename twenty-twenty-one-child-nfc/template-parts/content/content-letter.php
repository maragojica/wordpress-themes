                <p class="text-section text-center cl-black pt-4 pb-4">By Board Chair Jaimie Mayer and Interim CEO Rey Ramsey</p>
                <div class="copy-text cl-black">
                    <p>For many years, we and the other trustees of the Nathan Cummings Foundation have spoken about the need to invest in solutions that seek to dismantle oppressive systems and promote just, fair and sustainable outcomes.</p>
                    <p>This understanding is what drove us to decide, in November 2017, to align 100 percent of our financial investments with our mission—tearing down the wall between investment and programmatic decisions. In other words, we committed to put our money where our mouths are.</p>
                    <p>Questions about power in the allocation of foundation assets have been invisible for too long. But if we are serious about systems change, we must address them head on. If not, we risk perpetuating the worst behaviors of capital markets instead. Investing for social impact alongside financial returns has the potential to transform broken systems and mobilize markets as a force for good. But only if we examine dynamics of power.</p>
                    <p>Far too few foundations think about the race and background of the fund managers making decisions about their endowment resources, how these managers make their decisions, or how they impact economic power within our communities. Yet such decisions govern the vast majority of philanthropic capital at work in our society today. So, we wanted to flip the script. Given our focus on racial and economic inequality, why not make these questions both visible and indispensable?</p>
                    <p>Now you’re asking yourself, “But what about your financial returns? How much have you had to sacrifice on the altar of your values?”</p>
                    <p>Thanks to the skill and dedication of our investment advisors, we have not taken any “haircut.” Despite all the challenges the prior year brought us – or perhaps because of them – we believe our mission-aligned strategy produced stronger returns than our traditional approach would have. Our research had already convinced us this would be the case over the long term. And we are pleased to see it proven out in the short term also.</p>
                    <p> When we made the decision to take an all-enterprise approach to impact, we could not have known that the urgency for this approach would increase so dramatically over the past three years. Every issue that we care about—from racial and economic justice to climate change—has grown more urgent during this period of pandemic, polarization, recession, and racial awakening.</p>
                    <p>Today, nearly 95 percent of our endowment is in mission-aligned investments. But, in all candor, we still have a long way to go to shape the portfolio we envisioned at the time we made our big decision. We want to move even more of our assets into investments that are doing active good—not just avoiding harm. Screening out the bad is relatively easy. Finding creative and catalytic solutions to climate change and inequality takes time.</p>
                    <p>In this report, we’ll share all the details of this journey with you—including the things we wrestled with and had to learn the hard way. Now that we are on this path, we want to help our peers learn from our successes and missteps.</p>
                    <p>Financial markets deeply impact the issues we care about and the communities we serve. Philanthropic institutions like ours are products of, and active participants in, these markets. Impact investing is about how we participate—how we show up and change these systems from within.</p>
                    <p>We hope you’ll consider joining us.</p>
                    <p>In solidarity,</p>
                    <p>Jaimie Mayer, Board  Chair</p>
                    <p>Rey Ramsey, Interim  Chief  Executive  Officer</p>
